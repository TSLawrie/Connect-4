# Connect 4 for Terminal

This is a program that allows you to play Connect Four in your very own terminal, no internet connection required.

You can choose to play either on your own (against a bot) or with another person (on the same computer).

## Usage

To use this program in the CS50 IDE, simply execute `python -u connect4.py` in the terminal, making sure beforehand that you are in the directory where this file is located.

You will then be introduced to the game and asked whether to start a 1 or 2 player match.

This program assumes that you already know the rules of Connect Four.
